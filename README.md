# MATLAB Simulations Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB projects demonstrating my understanding of basic mechanics, motion, and mathematical modeling.

## Basics
- **Spring** → Mass-spring system simulation  
- **SinCos** → Sine and cosine wave plotting and analysis  
- **Projectile** → Simulates projectile motion with initial velocity and angle  
- **BounceBall** → Models bouncing ball motion with energy loss  

## Advanced
- Placeholder for future advanced simulations (PID, thermal systems, etc.)

## Purpose
This portfolio demonstrates my MATLAB skills, including:
- Mathematical modeling  
- Numerical simulation  
- Data visualization  

## Tools Used
- MATLAB R2025a
